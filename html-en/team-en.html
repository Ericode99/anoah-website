          <p class="modal-text">
            My Name is Noah Rechsteiner and I was born in Zurich on April 4,
            2000. At 15 I started my apprenticeship as a cook in the famous
            Widder Hotel in Zurich. Which is to date one of the best decisions I
            have ever made. Already during my apprenticeship, I participated in
            two different cooking competitions crowned with the participation at
            the national championships “Swiss Skills 2018”. <br /><br />After
            that, I grabbed my best friend Tobi (who is now head of kitchen in
            the ANOAH) and we went on a 4-month long journey through Asia. It
            was a trip that opened my eyes to plant based nutrition. After the
            trip, I went up north to go work in the two-star restaurant KOKS
            where I got introduced to the Scandinavian kitchen. <br /><br />
            The next stop was in Hiltl where I developed recipes. Hiltl is the
            oldest still existing vegetarian restaurant on planet earth.
            Creating, correcting, or testing recipes was extremely interesting
            and beneficial for me even though it was hard at times. After that,
            I started ANOAH 1.0, 2019 in Zurich, and ANOAH 2.0, 2020 in Zermatt.
            Now we are back to our roots with the ANOAH 3.0 and look forward to
            welcoming you soon!

            My name is Tobias Sahli, I was born and raised in the “Zürcher
            Oberland”
            <br /><br />
            My way to ANOAH started in school during my apprenticeship. I really
            got to know Noah during our trip through Iceland where we explored
            the country with a tent and backpacks. Rain, storm, and snow
            strengthened our friendship, afterward, we knew we could achieve
            anything together.
            <br /><br />
            I always was the kind of guy to do stuff the hard way because I know
            I will arrive at my goal strengthened. Thanks to this attitude I
            organized a wedding menu during my apprenticeship, helped Noah with
            his catering, and did my own catering for a birthday party.
            <br /><br />
            The four-and-a-half-month trip through Southeast Asia widened my
            horizon even more regarding that lifestyle. We could learn so much
            about plant based lifestyle cultures and gained general knowledge
            and life experiences.
            <br /><br />
            I love fruits and berries, especially if you can harvest and eat
            them fresh from the garden. This is one of many reasons why we at
            ANOAH focus on regionality and seasonality.
            <br /><br />
            Since the first ANOAH in Zurich was a huge success and a wonderful
            experience, I am incredibly excited for the upcoming time back in
            Zurich and for everyone who comes by.

            Cooking is my passion! A world in which I can immerse myself –
            forget the surroundings – 100% concentration on the product. We eat
            three times a day, seven days a week, all life long. The saying
            doesn't go without reason: you are what you eat!
            <br /><br />
            I like to work 8 to 13 hours a day to delight happy and cheerful
            guests. Cooking has become a big part of my life. The ever-changing
            team, all the different characters, the sweating together, the
            laughing together, the arguments together. The adrenaline flows
            through my body during a packed service and it ends with happiness
            and satisfaction when I see the smiles on my guests faces.

            My Name is Max and I came to Switzerland at 14 years of age to start
            my apprenticeship as a cook with Mr. Jacky Donatz. After graduation,
            I heard the mountains calling and went to Gstaad where I spent a
            season in the Hotel Bellevue in the 1 star Michelin Restaurant of
            Mr. Urs Gschwend.
            <br /><br />
            After that winter I went back to Zurich to start working at the
            Widder Hotel in Zurich. After one year of being back in the city I
            had enough, and I went back to the mountains again. I returned to
            Mr. Gschwend and Hotel Bellevue. There I woke my interest in being
            on the other side of the stove. So I began to study at the hotel
            management school Lucerne.
            <br /><br />
            For my first semester as an intern, I returned to the Widder hotel
            in Zurich where I had the honor to work in the noble whiskey bar.
            During that time I realized that I had a big interest in wine and
            spirits. Also, I got to know Noah there and had a blast working with
            him. After finishing my next semester, I spent 1.5 years working as
            a meeting and event coordinator in Hotel Schweizerhof in Zurich. I
            got to learn how to organize big events and how all the connections
            between the different divisions.

            When Noah first approached me with the idea of a vegan fine-dining
            restaurant, I was immediately excited. We were able to transfer this
            enthusiasm to our guests at ANOAH 1.0 & 2.0 and agreed that we would
            like to repeat this success. Together with our team, we are looking
            forward to bringing the versatility of vegan cuisine back to Zurich.

            In summer 2016 I started my apprenticeship as hotel manager at the

            little break I could join the ANOAH 1.0 team to work in the pop up
            at Langstrasse in Zurich. It was a truly unforgettable time of
            course positively speaking. After the success of ANOAH, I joined
            Vicafe. Since I am a coffee lover and slowly connoisseur I really
            enjoy working there as a barista.

            I developed this interest further by doing my apprenticeship at the

            My Name is Marlon Hare and I was born on October 27, 2000.
            <br /><br />
            In 2016 I started my apprenticeship at the Hotel Greulich in Zurich.
            I was able to gain experience there in all departments, which I
            enjoyed incredibly. I was taught early on how important
            communication and teamwork are.
            <br /><br />
            After three instructive years, I moved to Basel to work in the
            Design and Lifestyle Hotel Nomad. In the beginning, I was working at
            the reception and as a server in the restaurant. After a little
            while, I developed an interest in barkeeping, so I talked with my
            boss and I was taught the skill of bartending which I still have to
            practice a lot more of course.
            <br /><br />
            In January 2020 I got recruited as a cook for the Swiss army, where
            I got to know Noah in a special course for cooks. I grew up looking
            out for a good quality of food or that it is organic and also, I was
            thought to eat balanced meals. So I was very excited about the idea
            of being able to work on ANOAH 2.0. Now I am extremely looking
            forward to ANOAH 3.0 and hope to see you soon.

            My name is Tim Rosenberger and I see myself as a life artist. With
            my soon to be 22 years old, I have already worked in various
            professions. I am a trained “banker”, but quickly realized that the
            world behind a screen is not mine. I was drawn to the outdoors into
            nature.
            <br /><br />
            I discovered my passion for long-distance hiking. With a tent and
            backpack, I prefer to march through a whole country and get to know
            not only the landscape but also the inhabitants and cultures far
            away from mass tourism. In between my travels, I earned my bread in
            Switzerland through various odd jobs. Among other things, I worked
            for Greenpeace, helped in a CBD plantation with the harvest, and
            learned the serving craft. I experienced many events & catering in
            5-star hotels like the Bürgenstock or the Waldhotel Flims. In
            between, I briefly completed the army recruit school & worked for
            half a year as a teacher's assistant in an elementary school. I
            liked the teaching so much that I decided to start studying at the
            University of Education.
            <br /><br />
            But before I start my studies in the summer of 2022, I will put all
            my energy and power into ANOAH 3.0!

            My name is Elia Rechsteiner and I am the little brother of Noah. As
            an apprentice in a technical industry, I actually have little to do
            with gastronomy, but the passion for cooking runs in the family and
            is also reflected in ANOAH. Since the starting shots, I have become
            very interested in plant-based nutrition and have learned a lot. I
            was made aware of how limited my horizons were and what all is
            possible purely plant-based.
            <br /><br />
            The first time I worked in a restaurant business was in Zermatt, as
            a mulled wine seller. I was thrilled how well the teamwork worked
            and it gave me a good feeling to see how happy the guests were when
            they tasted a course for the first time. At the moment I deliver
            fresh black truffles for the ANOAH, which I search for with our dog
            Milow, our 1 year old Flat Coated Retriever at the Lägeren. Come by
            and see the truffle for yourself.
